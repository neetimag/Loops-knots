                                        <br>The land that gave birth to the legendary Orpheus and Spartacus, Bulgaria is a country with a long, tumultuous and fascinating history. It has been invaded, conquered and settled by Greeks, Scythians, Romans,
                                        Byzantines and Turks, all of whom left their indelible marks on the landscape. Bulgaria's medieval 'Golden Age', when the Bulgar Khans ruled over one of the largest empires in Europe, was bright but brief, while
                                        500 years of subsequent, brutal Turkish domination isolated the country from the rest of Europe. More recently, Bulgaria spent four decades as a totalitarian Soviet satellite, again leaving this small Balkan nation
                                        in the shadows as far as the Western world was concerned. It’s no wonder, then, that Bulgarians are so passionate about preserving their history and their culture, which has survived so often against the odds. In
                                        the last years of the 20th century Bulgaria began opening up, and is one of the newest members of the EU.

                                        food, folkloric tradition, and dialect. Croats share an overall sense of national culture; people often feel strongly about regional identities and local cultural variations, particularly food and language.

                                        <br>The Master Franchise Partner for Loop & Knots is IBDA CR s.r.o.; founded in 1995 the company has a long tradition celebrating over 15 years in business in the Czech Republic.</p>
                                    <p>The Czech Republic is one of the most beautifully magnificent and historically significant counties in the world.</p>
                                    <p>Generally the women are known as being quite beautiful and globally it has gained a reputation as being a hot bed (source) for leading models.</p>
                                    <p>The country also has firm roots and tradition in fashion, designers and producers.</p>
                                    <p>Women here are stylish and they indulge themselves with good looking clothing and fashion accessories.</p>
                                    <p>Positioned in the heart of Europe it has traditional links to both East and Western Europeans and Russia and most recently it has become an international hub of tourism and cultural exchanges from around the globe.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>After the fall of communism Czech’s were anxious for popular brands but lacked the purchasing power they enjoy today. This created a fashion conscious but frugal consumer which is the target of Loops & Knots.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>Where better to position the Loops & Knot Master Franchisee in a center the center of cultural Mecca where beauty and inspiration abound and creativity knows no limits?</p>
                                    <p> Prague will be the test site for launching our creative brands and designs, an exposition of beauty, for all the beautiful women of the world.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>Our credo is all women have inner and outer beauty, our mission simply to help accentuate it.</p>
