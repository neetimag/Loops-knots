        <p><strong>BULGARIA</strong>:
            <br>The land that gave birth to the legendary Orpheus and Spartacus, Bulgaria is a country with a long, tumultuous and fascinating history. It has been invaded, conquered and settled by Greeks, Scythians, Romans, Byzantines and Turks, all
            of whom left their indelible marks on the landscape. Bulgaria's medieval 'Golden Age', when the Bulgar Khans ruled over one of the largest empires in Europe, was bright but brief, while 500 years of subsequent, brutal Turkish domination isolated
            the country from the rest of Europe. More recently, Bulgaria spent four decades as a totalitarian Soviet satellite, again leaving this small Balkan nation in the shadows as far as the Western world was concerned. It’s no wonder, then, that
            Bulgarians are so passionate about preserving their history and their culture, which has survived so often against the odds. In the last years of the 20th century Bulgaria began opening up, and is one of the newest members of the EU.

            <ul>
                <li>Football first came to Bulgaria in the late nineteenth century courtesy of a Swiss sports teacher. First known as 'ritnitop' (from 'ritni!' meaning 'kick' and 'top' - short for 'topka', meaning 'ball').
                </li>
                <li>WINE. Those with a taste foe the other fine things in life might associate Bulgaria with wine growing. Bulgaria is one of the oldest yet most up-and-coming winemaking regions in the world.</li>
                <li>FORESTS. Maybe forests don 't immediatel sprin god to mind when thinking about Bulgaria, but if you were to know that forests account for over a third of Bulgaria's land area you may put more importance on their placement in this list.
                    BURIED TREASURE. Bulgaria is the new "El Dorado", a vast trove of buried treasure where recently unearthed graves have disclosed gold dating back to at least 4000BC. Thracian artefacts from royal tombs dating from the 5th and 3rd centuries
                    BC are to be found in museums across the country and new finds are being exhumed almost daily. Unfortunately, with new buildings going up everywhere, archaeologists are hard pressed to keep up with clearing sites due for construction.
                    But there is still plenty to see, including one of Bulgarias nine UNESCO World Heritage sites the Thracian Tomb of Kazanluk.

            <strong>CROATIA</strong>: <br>Croats in the Holy Roman Empire date back to the ninth century. Stories conne te the name "Croat" ( Hrvatc ) with a powerful militar chieftainy in the early Middle Ages and an Alan word for "friend." Regional
            cultures are considered variations on the larger category of "Croatian," including the cultures of Dalmatia, Istria, Slavonia, and Zagorija. These regions are characterized by differences in geography, traditional economy, food, folkloric
            tradition, and dialect. Croats share an overall sense of national culture; people often feel strongly about regional identities and local cultural variations, particularly food and language.

            <strong>SERBIA</strong>: <br>Serbs settled in the Balkan Peninsula in the 6th and 7th cent and accepted Christianity in the 9th cent. Their petty principalities were theoretically under a grand Zhupan, who usually recognized Byzantine suzerainty.
            Even among European states Serbia was noted for its high economic, social, and cultural level. Serbia 's predominant position in the new kingdom was a major cause for unrest in Croatia and Macedonia in the period between World Wars I and II.</p>

            The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia was established in 1992. The state of uncertainty and unrest had been a key power both in Military and Economy and ruled the European continent at one point of time. But being the premier State in the Midst of Balkan
